CURRENTLY working on this branch in an attempt to refactor the original code challenge.

I looked into modern backend design patterns and read a lot about Controller - Service - Repository. 

I am now working to implement this design pattern in my solution for the code challenge: simple 4 endpoint api with the intent of making it more "production ready".
