A friend showed me a job interview question to create a RESTful API with a few endpoints.

I have attempted to recreate that in JavaScript.

TO RUN:
cd to root directory of trainer-api/app.js

node app.js

connect to app in browser at : localhost:3000/trainers/

endpoints:
1. add new trainer: put request to trainers/
2. see all trainers: get request to trainers/
3. update a trainer: patch request to trainers/
4. see one trainer: get request to trainers/:id
